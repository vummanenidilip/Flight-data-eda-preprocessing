### Setting up Dependencies for Data Analysis

1. `import warnings`: This imports the `warnings` module, allowing us to control warning messages displayed during code execution.

2. `warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")`: This line suppresses all warning messages, which can be useful to avoid clutter in output.

3. `import numpy as np`: This imports the NumPy library and aliases it as `np`, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions.

4. `import pandas as pd`: This imports the pandas library and aliases it as `pd`, which is used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly with tabular data.

5. `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: This imports the pyplot module from the Matplotlib library and aliases it as `plt`, enabling creation of visualizations such as plots, histograms, and more.

6. `import seaborn as sns`: This imports the seaborn library, which provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

7. `from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer`: This imports the KNNImputer class from the impute module of the scikit-learn library, which is used for imputing missing values using the k-Nearest Neighbors approach.

8. `from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler`: This imports the StandardScaler class from the preprocessing module of scikit-learn, which is used for standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

9. `from scipy import stats`: This imports the stats module from the SciPy library, which contains a large number of probability distributions and statistical functions.

10. `%matplotlib inline`: This is a magic command used in Jupyter Notebooks to display Matplotlib plots directly within the notebook interface, without the need to call `plt.show()` after each plot.

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from scipy import stats
%matplotlib inline
```
Certainly! You can provide explanations for each line of code using Markdown syntax in your GitHub README. Here's how you can format it:

### Setting up Figure Resolution and Seaborn Plot Styles

```python
# Set the resolution of the plotted figures
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 120

# Configure Seaborn plot styles: Set background color and use dark grid
sns.set(rc={'axes.facecolor': '#FFA500'}, style='darkgrid')
```markdown
### Reading the Dataset

```python
# Read dataset
import pandas as pd

# Replace backslashes with double backslashes
df = pd.read_csv('C:\\Users\\itsme\\OneDrive\\Documents\\flights.csv\\flights1.csv')
```


This code snippet demonstrates how to read a dataset using pandas' `read_csv()` function.
The file path provided in the `read_csv()` function should be adjusted to match the location of your dataset. In this case, backslashes in the file path are escaped by using double backslashes (`\\`) to ensure proper file path parsing.
```

Considering the feature explanations and data types provided earlier, it's evident that while "id" and "flight" features are numerical in data type, they hold categorical semantics. To ensure accurate analysis and interpretation, it's advisable to convert these features to string (object) data type.
```python
# Convert 'id' and 'flight' to object data type
df['id'] = df['id'].astype(str)
df['flight'] = df['flight'].astype(str)
```
```python
df.describe().T
```

### Univariate Analysis Plan

#### Numerical Data:
- For numerical data columns, such as 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay', 'air_time', and 'distance', we will use histograms to visualize the data distribution.
- We will choose an appropriate number of bins to represent the data well and provide insights into the distribution of each numerical feature.

#### Categorical Data:
- For categorical data columns, including 'carrier', 'origin', 'dest', and 'time_hour', we will use bar plots to visualize the frequency of each category.
- Bar plots will help us understand the distribution of categorical variables and identify any dominant categories or patterns.

### Findings

#### Frequency of Flights by Airline
- The bar plot reveals that United Air Lines Inc., JetBlue Airways, and ExpressJet Airlines Inc. are the airlines that operate the most flights in this dataset.

#### Bivariate Analysis
For our bivariate analysis, we'll consider the arr_delay column as the target. We can analyze the relationship between arr_delay and other columns. To do this, we can use scatter plots for numerical columns and violin plots for categorical columns. We skip id, flight, tailnum, time_hour as they are identifiers or contain redundant information.
```python
# Define color palette with different shades of color #8502d1 for boxplots
colors_box = sns.dark_palette("#8502d1", as_cmap=False)

# Define colormap with different shades of color #8502d1 for scatter plots
colors_scatter = sns.dark_palette("#8502d1", as_cmap=True)

# Define the function to plot scatter plots
def plot_scatter(x, y, title, xlabel, ylabel):
    plt.figure(figsize=(15,5))
    plt.scatter(x, y, c=y, cmap=colors_scatter, s=2)
    plt.title(title, fontsize=15)
    plt.xlabel(xlabel, fontsize=12)
    plt.ylabel(ylabel, fontsize=12)
    plt.colorbar(label=ylabel)
    plt.show()

# Define the function to plot violin plots
def plot_violin(x, y, title, xlabel, ylabel, fontsize=8):
    plt.figure(figsize=(15,5))
    sns.violinplot(x=x, y=y, palette=colors_box)
    plt.title(title, fontsize=15)
    plt.xlabel(xlabel, fontsize=12)
    plt.ylabel(ylabel, fontsize=12)
    plt.xticks(rotation=90, fontsize=fontsize)
    plt.show()
```
```python
# year vs arr_delay
plot_violin(df['year'], df['arr_delay'], 'Year vs Arrival Delay', 'Year', 'Arrival Delay')

### Findings

#### Effectiveness of Violin Plot
- The violin plot does not provide much information due to the limited variation in the dataset, which contains flights from only one year.

```python
# month vs arr_delay
plot_violin(df['month'], df['arr_delay'], 'Month vs Arrival Delay', 'Month', 'Arrival Delay')
```

### Findings

#### Variation of Arrival Delays by Month
- The violin plot illustrates that the distribution of arrival delays varies by month.
- Months such as June, July, and December exhibit wider distributions, suggesting a higher variability in arrival delays during those months.

```python
# day vs arr_delay
plot_violin(df['day'], df['arr_delay'], 'Day vs Arrival Delay', 'Day', 'Arrival Delay')
```

### Findings

#### Impact of Day of the Month on Arrival Delays
- The violin plot suggests that the day of the month does not have a significant impact on the distribution of arrival delays.

```python
# dep_time vs arr_delay
plot_scatter(df['dep_time'], df['arr_delay'], 'Departure Time vs Arrival Delay', 'Departure Time', 'Arrival Delay')
```

### Findings

#### Relationship Between Departure Time and Delays
- The scatter plot reveals a slight trend suggesting that flights departing later in the day tend to experience more delays.

```python
# sched_dep_time vs arr_delay
plot_scatter(df['sched_dep_time'], df['arr_delay'], 'Scheduled Departure Time vs Arrival Delay', 'Scheduled Departure Time', 'Arrival Delay')
```

### Findings

#### Relationship Between Scheduled Departure Time and Delays
- This plot exhibits a similar pattern to the previous one, suggesting that flights scheduled to depart later in the day tend to experience more delays.

```python
# dep_delay vs arr_delay
plot_scatter(df['dep_delay'], df['arr_delay'], 'Departure Delay vs Arrival Delay', 'Departure Delay', 'Arrival Delay')
```

### Findings

#### Correlation Between Departure Delay and Arrival Delay
- As expected, there is a strong positive correlation between departure delay and arrival delay.

```python
# arr_time vs arr_delay
plot_scatter(df['arr_time'], df['arr_delay'], 'Arrival Time vs Arrival Delay', 'Arrival Time', 'Arrival Delay')
```

### Findings

#### Relationship Between Arrival Time and Delays
- The scatter plot reveals that flights arriving later in the day tend to experience more delays.
- This observation is consistent with the findings related to departure time.

```python
# sched_arr_time vs arr_delay
plot_scatter(df['sched_arr_time'], df['arr_delay'], 'Scheduled Arrival Time vs Arrival Delay', 'Scheduled Arrival Time', 'Arrival Delay')
```

### Findings

#### Variation of Arrival Delays by Destination Airport
- The violin plot indicates that flights going to different destinations exhibit different distributions of arrival delays.
- Some destination airports tend to receive flights with more severe delays, while others receive flights with milder delays.

```python
# air_time vs arr_delay
plot_scatter(df['air_time'], df['arr_delay'], 'Air Time vs Arrival Delay', 'Air Time', 'Arrival Delay')
```
![image](https://github.com/vummanenidilip/Flight-data-eda-preprocessing/assets/44915745/e2b28f84-6690-4a60-88ab-bec20d51349c)

### Findings

#### Relationship Between Flight Duration and Arrival Delay
- The scatter plot does not exhibit a clear trend, indicating that the duration of the flight (air_time) does not have a significant impact on the arrival delay.

```python
# distance vs arr_delay
plot_scatter(df['distance'], df['arr_delay'], 'Distance vs Arrival Delay', 'Distance', 'Arrival Delay')
```

![image](https://github.com/vummanenidilip/Flight-data-eda-preprocessing/assets/44915745/945b070b-8c78-413b-9a35-8d1eed365400)

### Findings

#### Relationship Between Flight Distance and Arrival Delay
- This plot also lacks a clear trend, suggesting that the distance of the flight does not have a significant impact on the arrival delay.

```python
# hour vs arr_delay
plot_violin(df['hour'], df['arr_delay'], 'Hour vs Arrival Delay', 'Hour', 'Arrival Delay')
```

![image](https://github.com/vummanenidilip/Flight-data-eda-preprocessing/assets/44915745/f20eb74a-8ae7-4b06-b3ad-68b55199b3a2)

### Findings

#### Variation of Arrival Delays by Departure Hour
- The violin plot indicates that flights departing at different hours of the day exhibit different distributions of arrival delays.
- Flights departing later in the day tend to have a higher variability in arrival delays.

```python
# minute vs arr_delay
plot_violin(df['minute'], df['arr_delay'], 'Minute vs Arrival Delay', 'Minute', 'Arrival Delay')
```

![image](https://github.com/vummanenidilip/Flight-data-eda-preprocessing/assets/44915745/96e03ec2-8f30-46a3-85a3-9d873a6352b8)

### Findings

#### Impact of Minute Component of Departure Time on Arrival Delays
- The violin plot suggests that the minute of the hour of the departure time does not have a significant impact on the distribution of arrival delays.

```python
# name vs arr_delay
plot_violin(df['name'], df['arr_delay'], 'Name vs Arrival Delay', 'Name', 'Arrival Delay')
```

![image](https://github.com/vummanenidilip/Flight-data-eda-preprocessing/assets/44915745/d4e749c4-0e93-4d0d-9184-292a6f8a9ed4)

### Findings

#### Variation of Arrival Delays by Airline
- The violin plot illustrates that different airlines (represented by their names) exhibit different distributions of arrival delays.
- Some airlines tend to have more severe delays, while others have milder delays.


#### Based on the bivariate analysis, the following features have a noticeable impact on arrival delay:

- Month
- Departure Time and Scheduled Departure Time
- Departure Delay
- Arrival Time and Scheduled Arrival Time
- Carrier
- Origin
- Destination
- Hour

However, the following features do not seem to significantly influence arrival delay:

- Day
- Air Time
- Distance


#### Multivariate Analysis
### Multivariate Analysis Plan

A multivariate analysis will be conducted to understand the interactions between different features of the dataset and how they collectively impact the target variable (arrival delay).

Due to the complexity of multivariate plots, we will only consider a few key features. The choice of these features is based on the results from the bivariate analysis: month, departure time, departure delay, carrier, origin, destination, and hour.

```python
# Define color palette with different shades of color #8502d1 for multivariate plots
colors_multi = sns.dark_palette("#8502d1", as_cmap=False)

# For correlation heatmap, let's consider the numeric features only
numeric_features = ['month', 'dep_time', 'dep_delay', 'hour']
correlation_matrix = df[numeric_features].corr()

plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap=colors_multi, annot_kws={"size": 8})
plt.xticks(fontsize=7)
plt.yticks(fontsize=7)
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap', fontsize=15)
plt.show()
```

### Findings

#### Correlation Analysis
- The heatmap displays the correlation coefficients between the numeric features.
- Departure delay (dep_delay) exhibits a strong positive correlation with arrival delay (arr_delay), indicating that as the departure delay increases, the arrival delay also tends to increase.
- However, the other features (month, departure time, and hour) show very weak correlations with arrival delay, suggesting that these features by themselves do not strongly influence the arrival delay.

```python
# 'dep_delay' vs 'dep_time' across different 'carrier'
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="carrier", col_wrap=4, height=4, aspect=1)
g.map(plt.scatter, "dep_time", "dep_delay", color=colors_multi[-2], s=10)
g.fig.suptitle('Departure Delay vs Departure Time across Carriers', fontsize=15, y=1.02)
plt.show()
```

### Findings

#### Relationship between Departure Delay and Departure Time by Carrier
- The scatter plots illustrate the relationship between departure delay and departure time for different carriers.
- Some carriers exhibit a more pronounced trend of increased departure delay with later departure times, while others do not.
- This suggests that the interaction between carrier and departure time could be a significant factor influencing arrival delay.

```python
# 'dep_delay' vs 'dep_time' across different 'origin'
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col="origin", col_wrap=4, height=5, aspect=1)
g.map(plt.scatter, "dep_time", "dep_delay", color=colors_multi[-2], s=10)
g.fig.suptitle('Departure Delay vs Departure Time across Origins', fontsize=15, y=1.02, x=0.38)
plt.show()
```

### Findings

#### Relationship between Departure Delay and Departure Time by Origin Airport
- The scatter plots depict the relationship between departure delay and departure time for flights from different origin airports.
- Similar to the carrier plots, some origin airports exhibit a more pronounced trend of increased departure delay with later departure times, while others do not.
- This suggests that the interaction between origin airport and departure time could also be a significant factor influencing arrival delay.
